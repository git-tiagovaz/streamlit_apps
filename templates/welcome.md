### 🗭 Welcome to Your Ecommerce Data Assistant

💬 Just ask your question in plain English — no SQL needed!

You can ask things like:
- “How many purchases did we have last week?”
- “Compare this month’s revenue to the last one”
- “Show top 5 countries by users in the last 30 days”

📊 Your assistant will:
1. Understand your question  
2. Query live GA4 or UA BigQuery data  
3. Show results with summaries

👈 Select a brand from the sidebar to get started. Then type your question below — we’ll handle the rest.

**Note:** Always confirm the data before making decisions. This assistant is here to help, not to replace your expertise.
